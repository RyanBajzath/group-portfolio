            <h2>Ryan Bajzath</h2>
            <p>
              I have a passion for learning, problem-solving, and creation, all
              of which are integral to the coding process. I thrive both
              independently and within collaborative environments and possess
              strong skills in planning, designing, and developing software
              solutions. Web development will be my home away from home.

            <p>
              Although my background is in Petroleum Engineering, I specialize
              in programming for companies in the oil and gas industry. I
              develop in-house software solutions to streamline engineering
              calculations, utilizing tools such as Visual C#, VBA, and Java. I
              also have experience in web development. In addition, I hold a
              certificate in Applied Cybersecurity and am currently pursuing a
              Certificate in Computers and Information Technology at McGill
              University.
